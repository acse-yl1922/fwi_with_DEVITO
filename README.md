# inversion-and-optimisation-assessment-1

Solutions for parts 1, 2 and 3 of the assessment are written in the notebooks `solution_part1.ipynb`, `solution_part2.ipynb` and `solution_part3.ipynb` respectively. Images are attached in solution_part1.ipynb for clarifying the model.
I also created another notebook for part 3 to include more nbl selection.
